# Security Policy

## Security Overview

The Alpha - Honeypot Threat Intelligence Solution is designed as an educational cybersecurity tool. While it includes security best practices, it is important to understand its intended use and limitations.

## Intended Use

This software is designed for:
- Educational purposes: Learning about honeypots and threat detection
- Research environments: Studying attack patterns and behaviors  
- Authorized testing: Testing in controlled, authorized environments
- Security training: Demonstrating cybersecurity concepts

## Important Security Considerations

### Not for Production Use
This honeypot is **NOT intended for production security systems**:
- It's designed for education, not real threat protection
- May not handle high-volume attacks appropriately
- Lacks enterprise-grade security hardening
- Should not be deployed on critical infrastructure

### Deployment Guidelines
If deploying for educational purposes:
- Use isolated networks or VMs
- Never deploy on production networks
- Ensure proper authorization before deployment
- Monitor resource usage and logs

## Security Features

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are sanitized
- SQL injection prevention (though we use CSV, not SQL)
- XSS protection in web templates
- CSRF protection via Flask

### Configuration Security
- Environment variable configuration
- Secure secret key generation
- Configurable network binding
- Debug mode controls

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data storage
- Minimal data retention
- Local file-based storage only
- No external data transmission (except IP geolocation)

## Reporting Security Issues

### Responsible Disclosure
We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly
3. **DO** email us privately at: ryancasey.dev@gmail.com

### What to Include

- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Varies by severity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released

## Security Testing

### Approved Testing
You may test for security issues if:
- Testing on your own deployment
- Using isolated environments
- Not affecting other users
- Following responsible disclosure

### Prohibited Activities
- Testing on others' deployments without permission
- Attempting to access unauthorized systems
- Using findings for malicious purposes
- Public disclosure before patches
